# Cryptography

## Overview of project  
> The idea behind this project is to showcase what I have learned from my cryptography course.
> I am doing this in conjunction with the Applied Mathematics 314 course at Stellenbosch University.
> The project is not for public use bot rather for personal practice to bothe practice my c/c++ skills and implementing and understading the algorithms in this course.

- Modulo arithmatic (including getting the modular inverse and powers)
- Polynomials 9implementing a simple polynomial datatype
- Polynomial modulo space
- Modulo polynomial arithmatic
- Diffie-Hawman key generation and exchange.
